# Color StyleS
**C**_olor_ **S**_tyle_**S**  â€” a CSS stylesheet for use in development environments to aid developers with a large set of terse classes for color and common stylings.

See Also "TinyTrim".



This was part of the CSS framework I was developing when I came across what became the WCAG color-contrast project.
